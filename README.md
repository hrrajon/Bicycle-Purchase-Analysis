# Bicycle-Purchase-Analysis
This project analyzes customer demographics and purchasing behavior using Excel. It involves data cleaning, pivot tables, and a dashboard to gain insights from factors like income, age, and commute distance. 

Project Overview
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing customer data to understand bike purchase patterns. The dataset includes customer demographics, income levels, commute distance, and other attributes that influence purchasing behavior.
Objectives
•	Clean and preprocess the dataset.
•	Create pivot tables to summarize key insights.
•	Design a dashboard with graphs to visualize customer trends.
Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the description of a YouTube video by Alex the Analyst.
Dataset Description
The data was sourced from an Excel spreadsheet containing customer demographic and purchase information, originally featured in a YouTube tutorial by Alex the Analyst. The dataset included columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike.
Data Cleaning Steps
•	Removed duplicate entries.
•	Standardized Marital Status to "Married" or "Single".
•	Standardized Gender to "Male" or "Female".
•	Removed "$" from Income and formatted it as a number.
•	Standardized Commute Distance into predefined ranges (0-1 Miles, 1-2 Miles, etc.).
•	Added Age Range categories: "Adolescent," "Middle Age," and "Old".
•	Ensured numerical columns (Income, Children, Cars, Age) were formatted correctly.

Pivot Tables & Insights
•	Income Analysis: Average income was calculated based on gender and purchase status. Males and females had similar income levels, with minor variations in bike purchases.
•	Commute Distance vs. Purchase: Customers commuting 0-5 miles were more likely to purchase bikes, with a decline for commutes over 10 miles.
•	Age Range vs. Purchase: Middle-aged customers were the largest group purchasing bikes, while adolescents had the least.

Key Findings
•	Customers with commute distances of 0-1 miles and 5-10 miles have the highest purchase rates.
•	Middle-aged customers are the primary bike buyers.
•	Male customers have a higher average income than females.
•	Customers who purchased a bike generally have a higher income than those who didn't.

Dashboard Overview
The dashboard includes four interactive charts:
•	Purchases by Gender: Bar chart with a slicer to filter by marital status.
•	Income Distribution: Bar chart showing average income, with a slicer for gender.
•	Purchases by Commute Distance: Bar chart displaying purchases based on commute range, with a slicer for region.
•	Purchases by Age: Bar chart showing purchases by age range, with a slicer for occupation.
Conclusion
This project highlights factors influencing bike purchases, including income, commute distance, and age. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore trends and patterns effectively.

How to Use
1. Open the Excel file and navigate to the Pivot Table and Dashboard sheets.
2. Modify filters in pivot tables to analyze different factors.
3. Use the dashboard for a quick visual summary of insights.
